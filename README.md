# sonarTreasureHunt_game-python

In this  game, the player drops sonar devices at various places 
in the ocean to locate sunken treasure chests. Sonar is a technology that 
ships use to locate objects under the sea. The sonar devices in this game tell 
the player how far away the closest treasure chest is, but not in what direction. But by placing multiple sonar devices, the player can figure out the 
location of the treasure chest.



There are 3 chests to collect, and the player has only 20 sonar devices 
to use to find them. Imagine that you couldn’t see the treasure chest.
. Because each sonar device can find only the distance from the 
chest, not the chest’s direction, the treasure could be anywhere on the ring 
around the sonar device.
The string represented an X, an O, or an empty space, and the index of the string in the list 
represented the space on the board. The Sonar Treasure Hunt game will 
have similar data structures for the locations of treasure chests and sonar 
devices.
